While we are bound to live in an age of measurement, we live in an age of mismeasurement, over-measurement, misleading measurement, and counter-productive measurement. This book [The Tyranny of Metrics] is not about the evils of measuring. It is about the unintended negative consequences of trying to substitute standardized measures of performance for personal judgement based on experience. The problem is not measurement, but excessive measurement and inappropriate measurement - not metrics, but metric fixation.",
